# Log Error

You are helping the user log an error/failure that just occurred during agentic coding. The PRIMARY goal is to identify what the USER did wrong in their prompting, context management, or harness configuration. This is about building USER skill, not cataloging model failures.

## Core Philosophy

Errors in agentic coding are almost always traceable to:
- **Bad Prompt** - Ambiguous, missing constraints, too verbose, wrong structure
- **Context Rot** - Didn't /clear, conversation too long, stale context polluting responses
- **Bad Harnessing** - Wrong agent type, didn't pass context to subagents, missing guardrails

The model is the constant. The user's input is the variable. Focus on the variable.

## Logs Directory

All logs are stored in: `~/.claude/claude_accessible/agentic-practice-logs/`
- Errors: `/errors/error-XXX.md`
- Metadata (for ID tracking): `/metadata.json`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Privacy Considerations**
- DO NOT include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data)
- Be mindful of private file paths that reveal sensitive system information

## Your Task

1. **Review the conversation** to identify what went wrong.

2. **Ask 5-8 pointed questions** focused on USER behavior:
   - "Your prompt was 4000 words. What were the 3 most important requirements?"
   - "Did you specify what NOT to do, or only what to do?"
   - "When did you last /clear? How full was context?"
   - "Did you verify the subagents received the critical context?"
   - "Was this reference material or explicit requirements?"
   - "What constraints were in your head but not in the prompt?"

3. **Trace the triggering prompt** - Get the EXACT prompt that led to failure.

4. **Be critical of the user** - They asked for this. Don't soften it.

5. **Log the error** with the template below.

6. **Commit and push the log**:
   - First, `cd ~/.claude/claude_accessible/agentic-practice-logs && git pull origin main` to get the latest state and avoid merge conflicts
   - Read metadata.json to get the next error ID
   - Create the error log file: `~/.claude/claude_accessible/agentic-practice-logs/errors/error-XXX.md`
   - Update metadata.json with incremented nextErrorId, totalErrors, and current timestamp for lastUpdated
   - Use Bash tool to git add, commit with message: "Log error #XXX: [Short descriptive name]", and push to main
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT initialize a new git repo - the repo should already exist with remote configured via home-manager
   - If push fails, the commit will remain local (silent failure - no warnings to user)

## Log Template

```markdown
# Error #[ID]: [Short Descriptive Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Project/Context:** [What were you working on]

## What Happened
[2-3 sentences - what went wrong specifically]

## User Error Category
**Primary cause:** [Pick ONE]

### Prompt Errors
- [ ] **Ambiguous instruction** - Could be interpreted multiple ways
- [ ] **Missing constraints** - Didn't specify what NOT to do
- [ ] **Too verbose** - Buried key requirements in walls of text
- [ ] **Reference vs requirements** - Gave reference material, expected extracted requirements
- [ ] **Implicit expectations** - Had requirements in head, not in prompt
- [ ] **No success criteria** - Didn't define what "done" looks like
- [ ] **Wrong abstraction level** - Too high-level or too detailed for the task

### Context Errors
- [ ] **Context rot** - Conversation too long, should have /cleared
- [ ] **Stale context** - Old information polluting new responses
- [ ] **Context overflow** - Too much info degraded performance
- [ ] **Missing context** - Assumed Claude remembered something it didn't
- [ ] **Wrong context** - Irrelevant information drowning signal

### Harness Errors
- [ ] **Subagent context loss** - Critical info didn't reach subagents
- [ ] **Wrong agent type** - Used wrong specialized agent for task
- [ ] **No guardrails** - Didn't constrain agent behavior appropriately
- [ ] **Parallel when sequential needed** - Launched agents that had dependencies
- [ ] **Sequential when parallel possible** - Slow execution due to unnecessary serialization
- [ ] **Missing validation** - No check that agent output was correct
- [ ] **Trusted without verification** - Accepted agent output without review

### Meta Errors
- [ ] **Didn't ask clarifying questions** - Could have caught this earlier
- [ ] **Rushed to implementation** - Skipped planning/verification
- [ ] **Assumed competence** - Expected Claude to infer too much

## The Triggering Prompt
```
[Exact prompt - verbatim]
```

## What Was Wrong With This Prompt
[Be specific and critical. What should have been different?]

## What The User Should Have Said Instead
```
[Rewritten prompt that would have prevented this error]
```

## The Gap
- **What user expected:** [Expected outcome]
- **What user got:** [Actual outcome]
- **Why the gap exists:** [Direct connection to user error above]

## Impact
- **Time wasted:** [X minutes]
- **Rework required:** [What needs to be redone]

## Prevention - User Action Items
1. [Specific action user should take next time]
2. [Another specific action]
3. [Consider adding to personal CLAUDE.md or workflow]

## Pattern Check
- **Seen this before?** [Yes/No - if yes, this is a habit to break]
- **Predictable?** [Should user have anticipated this?]

## One-Line Lesson (for the USER)
[Actionable takeaway about prompting/context/harnessing - NOT about model behavior]

---
*Logged on [timestamp]*
```

## Important

- Be CRITICAL of the user - they're logging this to learn, not to feel good
- Focus 80% on user error, 20% on model behavior
- The goal is to improve USER skill at agentic coding
- If the user can't identify their mistake, help them find it
- Sanitized logs are useless - be specific and honest
