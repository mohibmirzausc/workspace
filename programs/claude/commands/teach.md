# School Mode: Explain This Code (No Questions)

Teach me {{TARGET}} like I'm in school. Start from the beginning and go slowly.

1) Give a 5–10 line big-picture overview.
2) Then explain the code in blocks of 5–20 lines, line-by-line.
3) Teach any language/framework rules as they appear (brief concept + point to code).
4) After each block, ask one check-for-understanding question.
5) Trace one concrete example through the code.
6) End with a cheat sheet + what file to read next.

Be patient, structured, and avoid skipping steps.

**TARGET defaults to "this code" if not specified.**

Usage examples:
- `/teach` - teaches the current code in context
- `/teach the authentication flow in src/auth.ts` - teaches that specific file
- `/teach how React hooks work in this component` - teaches hooks concept
- `/teach the database schema setup` - teaches the schema
